This repository holds some code for decision trees
I wrote on my mobile using QPython while commuting.

The most interesting part is probably the functions I 
wrote for manipulating and printing the data.

The algorithm used for the decision tree is ID3 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm.
